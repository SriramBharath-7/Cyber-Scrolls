# 🕵️‍♂️ Insider Threat


## 📌 What Is an Insider Threat?

- An **insider threat** is a security risk that comes from individuals **within the organization** who have authorized access to systems, data, or networks.

- These insiders could be **employees**, **contractors**, **vendors**, or **partners**.

- They pose a threat by **misusing their access**—either **intentionally** or **accidentally**—to harm the organization.

## 🧃 Analogy: The Cafe Betrayal

- You own a popular cafe with secret recipes and tight security.

- But one of your trusted baristas copies and sells your secret formula to a rival.

- Despite locks and alarms, the **danger came from within** — someone you trusted.

- This represents the **unique risk of insider threats**: they bypass defenses not by hacking, but by using **authorized access**.
