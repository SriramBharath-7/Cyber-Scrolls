# 🟣 Purple Team


## 🤝 What is the Purple Team?

- The **Purple Team** is a **collaborative cybersecurity group** that merges the strengths of:
  - 🔴 **Red Team** – offensive security experts (ethical hackers)
  - 🔵 **Blue Team** – defensive security experts (analysts, responders)
- They work together to **enhance an organization’s overall security posture** by sharing insights, techniques, and feedback in real time.

## 🏰 Analogy: Defending a Kingdom

> In a medieval kingdom:
> - The **Blue Team** guards the castle from invaders.
> - The **Red Team** simulates invasions to train the guards.
> - The **Purple Team** is when both teams **collaborate** to strengthen the castle together—faster and smarter.
