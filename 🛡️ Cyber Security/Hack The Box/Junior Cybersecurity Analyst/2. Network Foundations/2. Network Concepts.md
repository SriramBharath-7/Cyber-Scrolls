#  üß† Network Concepts ‚Äì OSI, TCP/IP, Protocols & Transmission

## üß± OSI Model (7 Layers)
A theoretical model that helps understand how data flows through a network, layer by layer.

| Layer | Name             | Function & Examples                               |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 7     | Application      | User-facing services (HTTP, FTP, DNS)             |
| 6     | Presentation     | Format, encrypt, compress data                    |
| 5     | Session          | Manage communication sessions (start/end)         |
| 4     | Transport        | TCP (reliable), UDP (fast); breaks/reassembles    |
| 3     | Network          | Routing with IP addresses                         |
| 2     | Data Link        | MAC addresses, frames, error handling             |
| 1     | Physical         | Bits over cables or Wi-Fi                         |

üì¶ _Example_: Sending a file moves top-down from Application ‚Üí Physical. Receiving = bottom-up.

## üåê TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
A simplified, practical model used on the internet.

| Layer          | OSI Equivalent          | Function                                    |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Application    | 7, 6, 5                   | Web, email, file transfer (HTTP, SMTP)     |
| Transport      | 4                        | TCP/UDP for data delivery                   |
| Internet       | 3                        | Routing with IP, ICMP                       |
| Network Access | 2 & 1                    | Cables, NICs, Ethernet, Wi-Fi               |

üß≠ _Example_: Accessing a website uses HTTP ‚Üí TCP ‚Üí IP ‚Üí Ethernet/Wi-Fi

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Protocols
| Protocol | Layer       | Purpose                                      |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| HTTP     | Application | Load websites                                |
| FTP      | Application | Upload/download files                        |
| SMTP     | Application | Send emails                                  |
| TCP      | Transport   | Reliable, ordered delivery                   |
| UDP      | Transport   | Fast, no guarantee (used in streaming)       |
| IP       | Internet    | Routes packets across networks               |

## üì∂ Transmission

### üîÑ Transmission Types
- **Analog**: Continuous signals (e.g., radio)
- **Digital**: Binary signals (used in networks)

### üîÅ Modes of Transmission
| Mode        | Description                           |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Simplex     | One-way only (keyboard ‚Üí CPU)          |
| Half-Duplex | Two-way, but one at a time (walkie)    |
| Full-Duplex | Two-way, at the same time (phone call) |

### üì° Transmission Media
- **Wired**:
  - Twisted Pair (Ethernet)
  - Coaxial (TV, early Ethernet)
  - Fiber Optic (high-speed internet)
- **Wireless**:
  - Radio waves (Wi-Fi, mobile)
  - Microwaves (satellite)
  - Infrared (remote controls)

üß© **Key Takeaways**:
- OSI = theoretical (7 layers), TCP/IP = practical (4 layers)
- Protocols = agreed rules for devices to communicate
- Transmission = how data moves; mode + medium + signal type
