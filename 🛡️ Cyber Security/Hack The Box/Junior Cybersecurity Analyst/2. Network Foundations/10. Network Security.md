# üõ°Ô∏è Network Security

Network security involves protecting data, devices, and systems within a network from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption.

## üî∫ CIA Triad

| Principle      | Description                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Confidentiality | Only authorized users can access data        |
| Integrity       | Data remains accurate and unaltered          |
| Availability    | Systems/data are accessible when needed      |

## üî• Firewalls

A **Firewall** is a security system that filters network traffic based on defined rules.

### üîß Functions:
- Monitors **incoming/outgoing traffic**
- Enforces **access control policies**
- Blocks unauthorized connections
- Can log or alert suspicious activity

### üß± Types of Firewalls

| Type                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Packet Filtering         | Layer 3‚Äì4: Filters based on IPs, ports, and protocol types                  |
| Stateful Inspection      | Tracks connection states (e.g. TCP sessions) for smarter filtering          |
| Application Layer (Proxy) | Layer 7: Filters based on app-level data (e.g. HTTP requests)              |
| Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW) | Combines stateful inspection + DPI + IDS/IPS + app control                  |

### üè† Home vs Business Setup
- **Home**: Built-in software firewall in router/modem
- **Business**: Dedicated hardware firewall between modem and internal network

## üß† IDS vs IPS

| Feature      | IDS (Detection)                      | IPS (Prevention)                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Response     | Alerts administrators                | Blocks malicious traffic in real-time   |
| Placement    | After firewall / in DMZ / on hosts   | Same as IDS, but actively intervenes    |
| Example Tool | Suricata in monitor mode             | Suricata in inline blocking mode        |

### üîé Detection Techniques

| Type           | Description                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Signature-based | Matches traffic to known attack patterns          |
| Anomaly-based   | Detects behavior that deviates from the baseline  |

### üñ•Ô∏è IDS/IPS Types

| Type        | Description                                                    |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| NIDS/NIPS   | Network-based: Monitors traffic at strategic points (e.g., switch) |
| HIDS/HIPS   | Host-based: Runs on individual devices (monitors logs, traffic)  |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Network Security

| Practice               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Define Clear Policies  | Use **least privilege** principles in access control                        |
| Regular Updates        | Patch OS, firewall, IDS/IPS signatures regularly                            |
| Monitor & Log Events   | Review logs for early indicators of compromise                              |
| Layered Security       | Use defense-in-depth: Firewall + IDS/IPS + AV + Endpoint protection         |
| Penetration Testing    | Simulate attacks to test and improve your defense posture                   |
