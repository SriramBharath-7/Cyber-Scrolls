# 🛡️ Proxies – HTB Notes

---

## 🧠 What is a Proxy?

A **proxy** is a **mediator** device/service that sits **between a client and a destination**, intercepting and possibly altering or inspecting traffic.

> 📌 Key difference: A **proxy inspects traffic** (Layer 7), while a **gateway** just routes traffic without inspection.

### 🧩 Different Perspectives on Proxies

| Group               | Usage Example                                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Security Experts    | BurpSuite, SOCKS/SSH Proxies (e.g., Chisel, sshuttle)     |
| Web Developers      | Cloudflare, ModSecurity for WAF & traffic filtering        |
| Average Users       | “Hide IP” → Usually use **VPNs** (≠ proxy)                |
| Law Enforcement     | Often link proxies with illegal/anonymous activity         |

> ☠️ Common Mistake: Thinking "proxy = IP change". That’s **VPN behavior**, not necessarily proxy.

## 📚 OSI Layer

Proxies almost always operate at **Layer 7 (Application Layer)** of the OSI Model.

## 🧭 Types of Proxies

---

### 🔁 1. Forward Proxy (a.k.a Dedicated Proxy)

- The **classic type** of proxy people think of
- **Client** → makes request to **proxy**, proxy forwards it to **target server**
- Used in **corporate environments**, **BurpSuite**, etc.

#### 🛠️ Use Cases

- Restrict internet access in organizations
- Scan/filter outbound traffic for malware
- Modify or intercept requests (e.g., BurpSuite for pen testing)
- Act as **web filters**

#### 💡 Technical Behavior

- Most browsers (Chrome, Edge) obey **system proxy settings**
- Firefox uses **libcurl** (ignores system proxy), malware must be proxy-aware to function properly
- DNS tunneling can bypass this but is detectable with logging (e.g., Sysmon)

#### 🔎 Example

- Malware → Needs to use proxy-aware mechanisms to exfiltrate data
- HTTP request → Goes through Burp → Then to actual site

---

### 🔁 2. Reverse Proxy

- Proxy **in front of servers** to **handle inbound requests**
- **Internet client** → **Reverse proxy** → **Backend server**

#### 🛠️ Use Cases

- **Protects internal web servers** from direct exposure
- Load balancing
- Caching/static content offloading
- **DDoS protection** (Cloudflare)
- Reverse tunneling for C2 (Command & Control)

#### 🔥 Tools/Examples

- **Cloudflare** – WAF, DDoS mitigation
- **ModSecurity** – WAF inspecting malicious payloads
- Reverse proxy via **SSH tunnel** for hiding attacker traffic

### 🔁 3. Transparent vs Non-Transparent Proxies

| Type             | Client Awareness | Config Needed | Use Case Example                             |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Transparent      | ❌ No             | ❌ No         | ISP filtering, schools, cafes                 |
| Non-Transparent  | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes        | BurpSuite (manual proxy), org firewalls       |

- **Transparent Proxy**: Intercepts traffic **silently**
  - Client is **not configured**
  - Still performs inspection/modification
- **Non-Transparent Proxy**: Client **must know and be configured**
  - No access without config
  - Traffic explicitly routed via proxy

## 🧵 Summary Table

| Proxy Type         | Direction      | Client Awareness | Layer | Common Tools        | Use Case                          |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|-------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Forward Proxy       | Outbound       | Optional          | 7     | BurpSuite, Squid     | Web filtering, monitoring         |
| Reverse Proxy       | Inbound        | No (client unaware)| 7     | Nginx, HAProxy, Cloudflare | Load balancing, DDOS protection  |
| Transparent Proxy   | Either         | No                | 7     | Squid, pfSense       | ISP traffic filtering             |
| Non-Transparent     | Either         | Yes               | 7     | Burp, Fiddler        | Explicit proxy use                |

## 🕵️ Real-World Scenarios

- ✅ **Corporate Internet Access** → Forward Proxy filters outgoing traffic
- ✅ **Cloudflare** → Reverse Proxy shielding origin servers from attacks
- ✅ **C2 (Command & Control)** → Reverse proxy over SSH to evade IDS
- ✅ **BurpSuite** → Forward Proxy for inspecting/modifying HTTP traffic

## 🧠 Fun Fact

> Most malware isn't proxy-aware. If your organization uses Firefox (libcurl) and a web proxy, you **break most simple malware** out-of-the-box 🧠💥
