# 🌐 IP Addresses

## 📌 Overview
- Each host in a network can be identified by its **MAC address** for local data exchange.  
- For communication between different networks, **IPv4** and/or **IPv6** addresses are used.
- **MAC Address**: Like the exact floor/apartment of a building.
- **IP Address**: Like the postal address & district of the building.

---

## 📌 IPv4 Structure
- **32-bit binary** → grouped into **4 octets** (0–255) in dotted-decimal notation.
- Example:
  - Binary: `01111111.00000000.00000000.00000001`
  - Decimal: `127.0.0.1`
- Unique IP for each network interface (PC, printer, router).
- Total possible addresses: **4,294,967,296**.

## 📌 IPv4 Address Classes

| Class | Network Address | First Address | Last Address       | Subnet Mask     | CIDR  | Subnets  | IPs (usable+reserved) |
|-------|----------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------|----------|-----------------------|
| A     | 1.0.0.0        | 1.0.0.1      | 127.255.255.255    | 255.0.0.0       | /8    | 127      | 16,777,214 + 2        |
| B     | 128.0.0.0      | 128.0.0.1    | 191.255.255.255    | 255.255.0.0     | /16   | 16,384   | 65,534 + 2            |
| C     | 192.0.0.0      | 192.0.0.1    | 223.255.255.255    | 255.255.255.0   | /24   | 2,097,152| 254 + 2               |
| D     | 224.0.0.0      | 224.0.0.1    | 239.255.255.255    | Multicast       | -     | Multicast| Multicast              |
| E     | 240.0.0.0      | 240.0.0.1    | 255.255.255.255    | Reserved        | -     | Reserved | Reserved               |

## 📌 Subnet Masks
- Defines **network part** vs **host part** of an IP.
- Works with **CIDR** to divide networks into subnets.
- Example: `255.255.255.0` → `/24`.

---

## 📌 Network & Gateway Addresses
- Two reserved IPs in every subnet:
  - **Network Address** (identifies the network itself)
  - **Broadcast Address** (used to send data to all hosts in the network)
- **Default Gateway**: Router’s IP that connects different networks.

---

## 📌 Broadcast Address
- Sends packets to **all devices** in a network simultaneously.
- Always the **last IP** in the subnet.

---

## 📌 Binary System Refresher
- Binary system uses only `0` and `1`.
- **1 Octet** = 8 bits → Each position has a value (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).

### Example IPv4: `192.168.10.39`
| Octet | Binary        | Decimal |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 1st   | 11000000     | 192     |
| 2nd   | 10101000     | 168     |
| 3rd   | 00001010     | 10      |
| 4th   | 00100111     | 39      |

---

## 📌 Decimal to Binary Example (Subnet Mask)
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
- Binary: `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`

---

## 📌 CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
- CIDR notation replaces old fixed classes (A–E).
- Format: `IP/Number_of_1_bits_in_subnet_mask`
- Example:
  - IP: `192.168.10.39`
  - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
  - CIDR: `/24` → 24 bits set to `1` in the mask.

---

**🔑 Summary**  
- **MAC**: Local unique hardware address.
- **IP**: Logical network address (IPv4/IPv6).
- **Subnet Mask** & **CIDR**: Define network vs host bits.
- **Gateway**: Routes traffic between networks.
- **Broadcast**: Communicates with all hosts in subnet.
