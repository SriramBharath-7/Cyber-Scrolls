# 🧱 OSI Model – Full Overview (HTB Notes)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the OSI Model

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model was defined by **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)** to:

- Enable **communication** between different systems, devices, and technologies.
- Provide **compatibility** and **interoperability** standards.
- Create a **reference model** for how data flows between systems.

The model breaks network communication into **7 hierarchical layers**, each performing specific tasks.

## 🔢 OSI Model – 7 Layers

| Layer No. | Layer Name     | Function                                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 7         | Application     | Controls input/output of data; provides user-facing application services.                |
| 6         | Presentation    | Converts data into an application-independent format; handles encryption/compression.    |
| 5         | Session         | Manages logical connections between systems; handles sessions, logins, and reconnections.|
| 4         | Transport       | Ensures reliable delivery of data via flow control, segmentation, and error recovery.    |
| 3         | Network         | Handles routing and forwarding of packets between devices; assigns logical addressing.   |
| 2         | Data Link       | Provides error-free transmission over the physical layer; organizes bits into frames.    |
| 1         | Physical        | Converts data into electrical/optical/radio signals for transmission on physical media.  |

## 🧭 Layer Orientation

- **Layers 1–4** → **Transport-oriented**
- **Layers 5–7** → **Application-oriented**

Each layer:
- **Offers services** to the layer above
- **Uses services** from the layer below

> 💡 This modularity allows technology to evolve independently at each layer (e.g., changing transport protocols without affecting application logic).

## 🔄 Communication Flow

### 🔽 Sending Data (Sender Side)
1. **Application** creates data (e.g., web request).
2. Data is passed **down the layers** (7 → 1).
3. Each layer **adds headers/metadata** (Encapsulation).

### 🔼 Receiving Data (Receiver Side)
1. Physical signal arrives at **Layer 1**.
2. Data is passed **up the layers** (1 → 7).
3. Each layer **strips headers and processes** relevant information (Decapsulation).
4. Final usable data is handed to the **Application Layer**.

> 🧱 A packet goes **through all 7 layers twice** — once while being sent and once while being received.

Physical (L1)                   Physical (L1)

## 🛡️ Why OSI Matters in Cybersecurity

- Helps identify **where** in the stack a vulnerability or exploit occurs.
- Tools like **Wireshark**, **Snort**, and **Burp Suite** rely on knowledge of these layers.
- Layer-specific attacks (e.g., **ARP spoofing**, **TCP SYN floods**, **XSS**) are best understood through this model.

---

## ✅ Summary

- OSI provides a **standardized way** to visualize and manage network communication.
- Understanding the **role of each layer** is critical for **troubleshooting, security analysis, and protocol design**.
- As a pentester or cybersecurity expert, mastering this model allows you to analyze **traffic**, design **attacks**, and **defend systems** more effectively.
