# 🌐 Networking Topologies – HTB Notes

## 🔄 What is a Network Topology?

A **network topology** is the *arrangement* and *connection method* of devices (hosts and components) in a network.

- **Hosts**: Computers (clients, servers)
- **Network Components**: Switches, bridges, routers, etc.
- **Purpose**: Ensures logical and physical connectivity

> Topology defines how devices are structured (physically) and how data flows (logically).

## 📶 Physical vs Logical Topology

| Type              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Physical Topology | Actual layout: cabling plan, node positions, and connections                |
| Logical Topology  | Data flow behavior over the network medium (how data moves logically)       |

---

## 🧱 Three Core Areas of Network Topologies

### 1. 🔌 Connections

| Wired                     | Wireless           |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Coaxial Cabling          | Wi-Fi              |
| Glass Fiber Cabling      | Cellular           |
| Twisted-Pair Cabling     | Satellite          |
| Others                   | Others             |

---

### 2. 🔗 Nodes – Network Interface Controllers (NICs)

| Transmission / Routing Components     |
|--------------------------------------|
| Repeaters, Hubs, Bridges, Switches   |
| Router/Modem, Gateways, Firewalls    |

> A **node** is any connection point in the transmission medium that can send/receive signals.

---

### 3. 🧩 Classifications

Topologies can be:
- **Physical** – Actual structure (cabling, hardware)
- **Logical** – Data flow pattern regardless of actual layout

---

## 🕸️ Eight Basic Types of Network Topologies

---

### 1. 🔗 Point-to-Point

- **Direct** connection between two devices
- Used in **telephony**
- Simple, fast, and secure
- *Not to be confused with Peer-to-Peer (P2P)*

---

### 2. 🚌 Bus Topology

- All hosts share a **single transmission medium** (e.g., coaxial cable)
- **No central control component**
- Only **one host** can send at a time
- Others listen and determine if data is for them

---

### 3. ⭐ Star Topology

- **Central component** (hub/switch/router) connects to all hosts
- Each host has a **dedicated link** to the center
- All traffic goes through the central device
- Easy to manage but **central point of failure**

---

### 4. 🔁 Ring Topology

- Hosts connected in a **loop**
  - **One incoming** cable, **one outgoing** per host
- Uses a **protocol or token** to manage traffic
- Can be **physical** (looped cables) or **logical** (via star switch emulation)

---

### 5. 🕸️ Mesh Topology

- **Full Mesh**: Every node is connected to every other
  - High **reliability and bandwidth**
  - Common in **WANs/MANs**
- **Partial Mesh**: Some nodes have multiple connections, others only one

> ✅ Great for fault tolerance, especially in routers and backbone networks

---

### 6. 🌲 Tree Topology

- Extended **star topology** with hierarchy
- Logical/Physical tree structures
- Used in:
  - **Enterprise** structured cabling
  - **City networks (MANs)**
  - **Broadband systems**

---

### 7. ♻️ Hybrid Topology

- Combination of **two or more** topologies
- Example: Tree + Bus = Hybrid
- Not purely one type (e.g., two star networks connected via bus)

---

### 8. 🔗 Daisy Chain Topology

- Devices connected **in series** (like a chain)
- Signal passes **through each device**
- Used in:
  - **Automation (CAN networks)**
  - **Simple device chains**

> Not related to token protocols which are **independent of physical layout**

## ✅ Summary Table

| Topology      | Description                                                   | Example Use Case                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Point-to-Point| Simple direct connection between two devices                  | Traditional telephony                    |
| Bus           | All hosts share one transmission line                         | Legacy LANs                              |
| Star          | Central hub connects to all nodes                             | Home/Office networks                     |
| Ring          | Data flows in a loop via tokens or protocol                   | Fiber networks, Token Ring               |
| Mesh          | All nodes interconnected (full/partial)                       | Backbone networks, critical routers      |
| Tree          | Hierarchical stars; expands logically and physically          | Large buildings, structured cabling      |
| Hybrid        | Combo of topologies (non-standard structure)                  | Large enterprises                        |
| Daisy Chain   | Devices linked one after another in sequence                  | Automation (e.g., CAN buses)             |
