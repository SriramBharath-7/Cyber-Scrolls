# 🌐 Networking 101 for Cybersecurity – By Gh0stSh3ll 👻

A complete beginner-friendly breakdown of how Wi-Fi, internet, routers, modems, mobile data, and network security work.  
This marks the first steps in my journey to become an **Ethical Hacker & Cybersecurity Expert**.

## 🧠 What is a Network?

- A **network** is a group of two or more devices connected to exchange data.
- Examples:  
  - PC connected to printer (wired) → **LAN**  
  - Your laptop + phone + TV using JioFiber Wi-Fi → **Wireless LAN (WLAN)**

---

## 📶 What is Wi-Fi?

- **Wi-Fi** is a wireless method for devices to connect to a **router** using **radio waves** (2.4GHz or 5GHz).
- It doesn’t provide internet by itself.
- It simply gives **access to the router**, which may or may not be connected to the internet.

## 🔌 What is a Router vs Modem?

| Device | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Modem** | Connects to the **ISP** and brings the **internet** into your home |
| **Router** | Creates your **local network (LAN)** and shares the internet with devices |
| **Router + Modem Combo** | Like JioFiber – does both |

## 🛜 What is Mobile Data?

- Your phone’s SIM connects to a **cell tower** (wirelessly).
- The tower is connected to the **ISP’s core network**.
- Data travels through **fiber optic cables** to reach the internet.
- Mobile data = **No router needed**.

---

## 🔁 Can LAN exist without Internet?

✅ Yes!

- A **LAN (Local Area Network)** is just a group of connected devices.
- Even without internet, devices can:
  - Share files
  - Play games
  - Print documents
  - Host local servers

## 🧠 How to Find Your Local IP?

### Windows:
```bash
ipconfig
```


### 🌐 Visual of the Path:
```plaintext

📱 (Your Phone)
   ↓ (Radio Waves)
📡 Cell Tower
   ↓ (Fiber Optic)
🏢 ISP Core (Jio, Airtel)
   ↓ (Global Internet Backbone)
🖥️ Netflix Server
   ↓ (Back again)
📡 Tower
   ↓ (Radio Waves)
📱 (You get the movie!)
```


# How Mobile Data Works

- 📱 Your phone sends data via **radio waves** to a nearby cell tower
- 🛰️ Tower sends it through **fiber optic cables** to your **ISP (Jio, Airtel)**
- 🌐 ISP routes the data to services like Netflix, Google, etc.
- 🖥️ Servers respond with data (videos, webpages)
- 🔄 The response travels the same route back to your device

✅ It's always a mix of:
- Radio Waves (Wireless)
- Fiber Optic (Physical cables)
