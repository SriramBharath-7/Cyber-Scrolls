## 🧠 What is a Network?

- A **network** is a group of two or more devices connected to exchange data.
- Examples:  
  - PC connected to printer (wired) → **LAN**  
  - Your laptop + phone + TV using JioFiber Wi-Fi → **Wireless LAN (WLAN)**

## 📶 What is Wi-Fi?

- **Wi-Fi** is a wireless method for devices to connect to a **router** using **radio waves** (2.4GHz or 5GHz).
- It doesn’t provide internet by itself.
- It simply gives **access to the router**, which may or may not be connected to the internet.

|--------|----------|
| **Modem** | Connects to the **ISP** and brings the **internet** into your home |
| **Router** | Creates your **local network (LAN)** and shares the internet with devices |
| **Router + Modem Combo** | Like JioFiber – does both |

## 🛜 What is Mobile Data?

- Your phone’s SIM connects to a **cell tower** (wirelessly).
- The tower is connected to the **ISP’s core network**.
