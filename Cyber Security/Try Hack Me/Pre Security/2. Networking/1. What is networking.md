## 🧠 Task 1 – What is Networking?

- A **network** = two or more devices connected.
- Not limited to computers (e.g., postal systems, transportation networks).
- In cybersecurity, we focus on **digital networks** (devices like PCs, phones, etc.).
- Key Term Answer: **Network**

---

## 🛜 Task 2 – What is the Internet?

- The **Internet** = a large network made up of many smaller **private networks**.
- These private networks connect through **public networks** (ISPs).
- Internet originated from **ARPANET** (historical context).
- Visualization: small home/office networks connected via ISPs to form the global Internet.
- Inventor of the World Wide Web: **Tim Berners-Lee**
- Key Answers:
  - Public networks connect private ones.
  - The web was invented by **Tim Berners-Lee**

---

## 🧩 Task 3 – Identifying Devices on a Network

### 🔢 IP Addresses

- **IP** = Internet Protocol
- Think of IP as a **device’s name**.
- IP address = 4 **octets** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- Private IP = used within the local network.
- Public IP = used on the Internet (assigned by your ISP).
- Multiple devices on a private network can share the **same public IP** via NAT.

### 🔍 MAC Addresses

- **MAC** = Media Access Control
- Think of MAC as a **device’s fingerprint** (burned into NIC hardware).
- Format: 6 hex pairs (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`)
  - First half = vendor
  - Second half = unique identifier
- **Spoofing** = faking a MAC address (e.g., to gain unauthorized Wi-Fi access).

### 📖 MAC Spoofing Example

- Alice paid for Wi-Fi, Bob didn’t.
- Bob spoofs Alice’s MAC address to **bypass authentication** and access Wi-Fi.

### ✅ Key Answers:
- IP = **Internet Protocol**
- Each section of an IP = **Octet**
- IP address has: **4 sections**
- MAC = **Media Access Control**

---

## 🛰 Task 4 – What is Ping?

- `ping` is a command-line **network diagnostic tool**.
- Sends a message to a device asking: *"Are you there?"*
- Uses **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**.
- Often used to check **connectivity** between two devices.

### 📌 Example

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8  # Sends 4 pings (Linux/macOS)
```

## 🛰️ Networking Basics

### 🌐 What is Networking?
- **Definition**: Connection between devices for data sharing.
- **A network** is formed even when only 2 devices are connected.

### 🕸️ What is the Internet?
- A **collection of interconnected smaller networks**.
- Contains **public** and **private** networks.
- Public IP connects you to the internet (assigned by ISP).
- Private IP is used within local networks (like home WiFi).

### 📍 Identifying Devices on a Network
- **IP Address**: Logical identifier, can change.
- **MAC Address**: Physical identifier, usually fixed.
- IP = Name  
  MAC = Fingerprint

### 🔄 Public vs Private IP
- Devices in same private network share the **same public IP**.
- Each device has a unique **private IP**.

### ⚙️ IPv4 vs IPv6
- IPv4: Four octets (0-255)
- IPv6: Longer format, created due to exhaustion of IPv4

### 🔍 Ping Tool
- Used to check if a device is reachable.
- Protocol: ICMP
- Example: `ping 8.8.8.8`

## 🏠 LAN (Local Area Network)

### 📐 LAN Topologies
- **Ring**: All devices in a circle (break = whole net fails).
- **Bus**: One backbone line (cheap, but traffic issues).
- **Star**: Devices connected to central switch (reliable, expensive).

### 🔌 Switches vs Routers
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a LAN.
- **Router**: Connects different networks together.

---

## 🧩 Subnetting Basics
- **Subnetting**: Dividing a large network into smaller segments.
- Each IP address = `Network + Host`
- Example: 192.168.1.0/24  
  - Network = 192.168.1  
  - Hosts = 0–255

### Key IPs:
- **Network Address**: Start of a network (e.g., `.0`)
- **Broadcast Address**: End of network (e.g., `.255`)
- **Default Gateway**: Routes traffic to other networks

---

## 🔄 ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- Resolves IP → MAC
- **ARP Request**: Who has 192.168.1.10?
- **ARP Reply**: I do! Here's my MAC.
- Stored in ARP cache

---

## 🎯 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Assigns IP addresses dynamically
- DHCP Process:
  1. Discover
  2. Offer
  3. Request
  4. Acknowledge

## 🌐 What is the OSI Model?

- **OSI**: Open Systems Interconnection model
- Describes how devices communicate across a network
- Divided into **7 layers** (Application to Physical)
- **Encapsulation**: At each layer, additional data is wrapped around the original message (like stacking capsules)
- **Decapsulation**: Unwrapping each layer in reverse when receiving data

---

## 🧩 7 Layers of the OSI Model (Top to Bottom)

| Layer No | Layer Name         | Mnemonic: All People Seem To Need Data Processing |
|----------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 7        | Application         | All                                                |
| 6        | Presentation        | People                                             |
| 5        | Session             | Seem                                               |
| 4        | Transport           | To                                                 |
| 3        | Network             | Need                                               |
| 2        | Data Link           | Data                                               |
| 1        | Physical            | Processing                                         |
