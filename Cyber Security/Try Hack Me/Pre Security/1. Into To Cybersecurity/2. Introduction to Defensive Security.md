# 🛡️ TryHackMe Notes – What Is Defensive Security?

## 🔄 Recap from Previous Room

- **Offensive Security** = "Think like a hacker" 🧠💣
- Involves exploiting:
  - Software bugs
  - Misconfigurations
  - Weak access controls
- **Roles**: Penetration Tester, Red Teamer

---

## 🧱 What Is Defensive Security?

> 🛡️ Defensive Security = Preventing and detecting attacks

- **Main Goals**:
  1. **Prevent intrusions** before they happen
  2. **Detect intrusions** and respond effectively

- **Blue Teams** specialize in defensive operations.

---

## 🧰 Key Defensive Security Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧠 **User Awareness Training** | Educating users to avoid phishing & social engineering. |
| 🗂️ **Asset Management** | Keeping inventory of systems and devices to protect. |
| 🛠️ **Patching Systems** | Regular updates to close known vulnerabilities. |
| 🔥 **Firewalls & IPS** | Firewalls filter traffic, IPS blocks known attacks. |
| 📊 **Logging & Monitoring** | Detecting unauthorized devices or suspicious behavior. |

---

## 🧠 Additional Concepts to Learn

- **SOC (Security Operations Center)**  
  Central team for monitoring, detecting, and responding to threats.

- **Threat Intelligence**  
  Gathering info about current and emerging cyber threats.

- **DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)**  
  Investigating incidents and preserving digital evidence.

- **Malware Analysis**  
  Understanding malicious code behavior to defend against it.

---

## 🧩 Takeaway

Defensive security is all about:
- **Visibility**
- **Preparedness**
- **Proactive response**

> 🧠 Learn to think like an attacker. 🛡️ Defend like a guardian.

# 🛡️ TryHackMe Notes – SOC, DFIR, Threat Intel, Malware Analysis

## 📍 Overview

This task covers key defensive security domains:
- Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Threat Intelligence
- DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)
- Malware Analysis

---

## 🏢 Security Operations Center (SOC)

> A SOC is a **centralized team** of cyber professionals monitoring systems & networks to detect malicious events.

### 🔎 SOC Focus Areas

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔓 Vulnerabilities | Weaknesses in systems that need patching or mitigation. |
| 📜 Policy Violations | Breaking security rules (e.g., uploading confidential files to public storage). |
| 🚫 Unauthorized Activity | E.g., compromised credentials used for unauthorized login. |
| 💥 Network Intrusions | Detecting breaches via phishing, exploit, etc. as early as possible. |

---

## 🧠 Threat Intelligence

> Understanding who your enemies are, what they want, and how they operate.

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Collect data** (from logs, forums, malware samples)
2. **Process data** (clean and organize it)
3. **Analyze** for:
   - Threat actor identification
   - Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs)
   - Predict future behavior
4. **Output** actionable insights & defense recommendations

### 💡 Goal:
Achieve **threat-informed defense** and build proactive strategies.

---

## 🧪 DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)

### 🧬 Digital Forensics

> Applying science to extract & analyze digital evidence after an incident.

#### 🧰 Key Evidence Sources

- 🗃️ **File System**: Deleted files, installed programs, hidden data.
- 🧠 **System Memory**: Reveals malware running only in RAM.
- 📋 **System Logs**: Tracks user & system behavior.
- 🌐 **Network Logs**: Shows traffic history, exfiltration patterns, attacker IPs.

---

### 🚨 Incident Response (IR)

> A structured approach to **detecting**, **responding to**, and **recovering from** cyber incidents.

#### 🧭 Four Phases

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ Preparation | Have a trained team & documented plan ready. |
| 2️⃣ Detection & Analysis | Spot incidents and assess their impact. |
| 3️⃣ Containment, Eradication, Recovery | Stop the threat, clean the system, and restore normal operation. |
| 4️⃣ Post-Incident | Document lessons learned and prevent recurrence. |

---

## 💣 Malware Analysis

> Study of **malicious software** to understand how it works and how to defend against it.

### 🧿 Common Malware Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🦠 Virus | Attaches to programs, spreads, modifies or deletes files. |
| 🐴 Trojan Horse | Appears useful, but secretly malicious (e.g. remote access). |
| 🔐 Ransomware | Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption. |

### 🧪 Analysis Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔍 **Static Analysis** | Examine malware *without* running it (code review, strings, assembly). |
| 🧪 **Dynamic Analysis** | Run in sandboxed environment and monitor behavior (network calls, file changes). |

---

## 📌 Summary

- SOCs are the **nerve centers** of cybersecurity detection & response.
- Threat intelligence enables **proactive defense** against real-world adversaries.
- DFIR is about **understanding & responding** to attacks while preserving digital evidence.
- Malware analysis helps us **uncover and counter** malicious tools.

> 🧠 Know the enemy. 🛡️ Prepare the defense. 🔬 Study the evidence.
