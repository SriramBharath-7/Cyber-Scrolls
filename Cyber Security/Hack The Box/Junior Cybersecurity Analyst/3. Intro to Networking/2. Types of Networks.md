#  🌐 Network Types

Networks are categorized by structure, range, and how devices connect. Below are both **practical terms** commonly used in cybersecurity and **"book terms"** used in formal networking theory.

## 🧰 Common Terminology

| **Type**   | **Definition**                                                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WAN        | Internet or large inter-network systems                                |
| LAN        | Internal network, e.g., home or office                                 |
| WLAN       | LAN accessed over Wi-Fi                                                |
| VPN        | Connects remote devices or networks into a unified LAN                 |

---

### 🌍 WAN – Wide Area Network
- Typically refers to **The Internet**
- A WAN joins multiple LANs
- Often uses **BGP** (Border Gateway Protocol)
- IPs **not** in private RFC 1918 ranges
- Can also refer to **private WANs** in enterprises or governments

---

### 🏠 LAN / WLAN – Local Area Network
- Uses **private IP ranges** (RFC 1918):
  - `10.0.0.0/8`
  - `172.16.0.0/12`
  - `192.168.0.0/16`
- LAN = Wired, WLAN = Wireless (Wi-Fi)
- Functionally similar; WLAN adds a wireless interface
- May sometimes receive public IPs (e.g., in universities or hotels)

---

### 🛡️ VPN – Virtual Private Network
Used to simulate being part of a different (usually internal) network.

#### 📡 Site-to-Site VPN
- Connects two networks directly (typically routers/firewalls)
- Common in businesses for connecting branch offices

#### 💻 Remote Access VPN
- Your device gets a **virtual network interface**
- Used in **HTB** via OpenVPN (TUN Adapter)
- May use **Split-Tunnel** (only lab traffic routes via VPN)
  - Good for HTB privacy
  - Risky for enterprises if malware bypasses detection

#### 🌐 SSL VPN
- Web-based VPN (in browser)
- Streams desktops/apps directly
- Used in HTB Pwnbox

## 📘 Book Terms

| **Type**   | **Definition**                                                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GAN        | Global Area Network – e.g., the Internet                               |
| MAN        | Metropolitan Area Network – connects LANs in a city or region          |
| PAN/WPAN   | Personal Area Network – Bluetooth or USB-based close-range network     |

---

### 🌐 GAN – Global Area Network
- A **global** collection of WANs
- Not limited to the Internet
- Used by global enterprises with internal WANs
- Uses **undersea cables**, **satellite links**, or **fiber optics**

---

### 🏙️ MAN – Metropolitan Area Network
- High-speed network for cities or large campuses
- Uses **leased fiber lines** and powerful routers
- Comparable speeds to LANs
- Acts as a bridge between LANs and WANs

---

### 📲 PAN / WPAN – Personal Area Network
- Short-range device-to-device communication
- **PAN** = Wired (e.g., USB)
- **WPAN** = Wireless (e.g., Bluetooth, ZigBee)
- **Piconet** = A WPAN formed via Bluetooth
- Used in **IoT/smart home** systems with low data needs

---

## ✅ Summary
- **WAN/LAN/WLAN/VPN** are key for real-world and hacking scenarios.
- **Book terms** like GAN, MAN, and WPAN are useful for certification and exams.
- **VPN types** differ by use case: site-to-site for businesses, remote access for individuals, and SSL for browser-based access.
