# 🌐 OSI vs TCP/IP Models – HTB Notes

## 🧠 What are Networking Models?

Networking models are **layered frameworks** that describe how **data is transmitted** between two hosts on a network. They help standardize how systems communicate.

There are two key models:

1. **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection)
2. **TCP/IP Model** (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

## 🧩 The OSI Model (7 Layers)

| Layer No. | Layer Name         | PDU (Protocol Data Unit) |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| 7         | Application         | Data                      |
| 6         | Presentation        | Data                      |
| 5         | Session             | Data                      |
| 4         | Transport           | Segment / Datagram        |
| 3         | Network             | Packet                    |
| 2         | Data Link           | Frame                     |
| 1         | Physical            | Bit                       |

- Published by **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)** and **ITU**
- Strict protocol separation
- Used more as a **theoretical model**

> 🎯 Each layer has a **specific task**, and PDUs change as data moves down or up the layers (encapsulation & decapsulation).

## 🧩 The TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)

| Layer No. | Layer Name     | PDU             |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| 4         | Application     | Data             |
| 3         | Transport       | Segment          |
| 2         | Internet        | Packet           |
| 1         | Link            | Frame / Bit      |

- **Real-world model** used on the internet today
- Includes protocols like **TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP**
- Looser and more practical compared to OSI

> 🌐 The internet itself is **built upon TCP/IP** and its family of protocols

## 📦 Encapsulation & Packet Transfers

### 🔄 Encapsulation Process

1. Data starts at the **Application Layer**.
2. Each layer **adds a header** for control and routing (encapsulation).
3. The data is transmitted over the **Physical Layer** (binary transmission).
4. At the receiver’s end, each layer **removes the header** (decapsulation).
5. Final data is passed to the **Application Layer** for use.

> 🧱 Think of it like packing a letter inside multiple envelopes. Each layer adds an envelope, and the receiver unpacks each one.

### 📚 Example Layer-wise PDU Names (OSI vs TCP/IP)

| Layer               | OSI Model       | TCP/IP Model  | PDU Type             |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Application         | 7, 6, 5          | 4              | Data                  |
| Transport           | 4                | 3              | Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP) |
| Network             | 3                | 2              | Packet                |
| Data Link           | 2                | 1              | Frame                 |
| Physical            | 1                | 1              | Bits (Binary Stream)  |

## 🧪 Penetration Testing Perspective

- **TCP/IP** helps quickly understand the connection and identify potential entry points.
- **OSI Model** allows **deep inspection**, layer-by-layer traffic analysis.
- Both models are essential for **network traffic analysis** and **exploit development**.

> 🔍 Tools like **Wireshark** rely on OSI layer understanding to dissect packets during analysis.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- **OSI Model** is **educational** and great for deep dive analysis.
- **TCP/IP Model** is **real-world practical** and governs the modern internet.
- **Encapsulation** ensures proper data delivery by wrapping content in layer-specific headers.
- **Understanding both** helps you become a better pentester, especially when analyzing or crafting network traffic.
