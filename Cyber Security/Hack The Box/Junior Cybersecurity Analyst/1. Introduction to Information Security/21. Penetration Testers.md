# 🕵️‍♂️ Penetration Testers (Ethical Hackers)


## 💡 Who Are They?

A **Penetration Tester**, also known as an **Ethical Hacker**, is a cybersecurity professional who simulates cyberattacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities—**legally and ethically**. Their mission? To discover flaws before real hackers do.

> 🏠 **Analogy:**  
> Like hiring a locksmith to break into your house to test your security, Penetration Testers expose weaknesses in digital systems so they can be fixed.
