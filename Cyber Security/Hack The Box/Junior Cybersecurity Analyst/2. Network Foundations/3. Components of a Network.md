# 🧩 Components of a Network – Devices, Media & Software

## 📱 End Devices
- Also called **hosts** (e.g., laptops, smartphones, IoT).
- Send/receive data, interface with the network.
- Example: A student uses Wi-Fi on a laptop to access online classes.

## 🔁 Intermediary Devices
Devices that **forward**, **route**, or **regulate** traffic between end devices.

| Device       | Function                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Router       | Directs packets between networks using IP addresses (Layer 3)            |
| Switch       | Connects devices within a LAN; forwards data based on MAC (Layer 2)      |
| Modem        | Connects LAN to ISP; modulates digital ↔ analog signals                  |
| Access Point | Enables wireless devices to join wired networks                          |

## 💳 Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- Hardware that connects a device to the network.
- Has a **unique MAC address**.
- Types: **Ethernet (wired)** and **Wi-Fi adapters (wireless)**.

---

## 🌐 Network Media
**Wired**: Ethernet, fiber-optic, coaxial  
**Wireless**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Infrared, Microwave

### 🔌 Cabling & Connectors
- **RJ-45**: Common Ethernet plug.
- Quality impacts speed, reliability, and signal range.

## 📜 Network Protocols
Rules for **data formatting, transmission, and routing**.

| Protocol | Purpose                          |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| TCP/IP   | Internet communication foundation|
| HTTP/S   | Web browsing                     |
| FTP      | File transfer                    |
| SMTP     | Sending emails                   |

Functions:
- **Addressing**
- **Segmentation**
- **Error checking**
- **Routing**
- **Synchronization**

---

## 🛠️ Network Software

### 🧠 Network Management Software
- Monitors performance, configures devices, detects faults.
- Example: Detects suspicious traffic, updates firmware remotely.

### 🔥 Software Firewalls
- Host-based, controls **incoming/outgoing traffic** per rules.
- Example: Windows Firewall, Linux `iptables`.

---

## 🖥️ Servers
- Provide services/resources to client devices.
- Types:
  - **Web Server** (HTTP)
  - **File Server**
  - **Mail Server** (SMTP)
  - **Database Server**

### Key Functions:
- Centralized data & authentication
- Resource sharing
- Run OS tuned for multi-client requests

🧪 _Example_: Your browser requests a web page → Web server sends back data.

---

## 🧠 Final Recap
- **End Devices**: Interface for users  
- **Intermediaries**: Manage & route data  
- **Servers**: Provide services  
- **Media + Protocols**: Enable smooth, secure communication  
- All together → the **backbone of global networking**
