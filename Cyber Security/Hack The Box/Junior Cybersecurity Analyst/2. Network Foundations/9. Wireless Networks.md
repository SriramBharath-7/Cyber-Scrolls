## ✅ Advantages vs ⚠️ Disadvantages

| Advantages       | Description                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📱 Mobility       | Freely move around within the network’s coverage area       |
| 🔧 Easy Setup     | No cables = simpler installation                            |
| 🔁 Scalable       | Easy to add new devices                                     |

| Disadvantages    | Description                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌩 Interference   | Signal issues due to walls, electronics, or weather         |
| 🔓 Security Risk  | Easier to intercept without proper encryption               |
| 🐢 Speed Limit     | Slower than wired networks of the same generation          |

## 📡 Wireless Router

A wireless router performs two key roles:

- **Routing**: Directs data within the local network and to/from the internet
- **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**: Broadcasts Wi-Fi signals to devices

### 🔧 Components

| Component           | Description                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| WAN Port            | Connects to ISP via modem (Internet access)              |
| LAN Ports           | Wired connections for local devices                      |
| Antennae            | Transmit/receive wireless signals                        |
| Processor & Memory  | Manage routing and network tasks                         |

## 🔥 Mobile Hotspot

- **Shares cellular data** from a phone/device via Wi-Fi
- Ideal for **on-the-go** internet access
- Range: A few meters  
- Uses **4G/5G cellular** networks  
- Protected by password  
- ⚠️ Can quickly drain battery  

**💡 Example**: Use phone hotspot during travel to connect a laptop.

## 🗼 Cell Tower

A **cell tower** is a structure that enables cellular communication via **radio transmitters and antennas**.

### 📶 How It Works

1. Covers a “cell” — a specific area in the mobile network
2. Managed by a **Base Station Controller (BSC)**
3. Connected to core network via **backhaul** (fiber or microwave)
4. Maintains call/data sessions when moving across towers

### 🧱 Types

| Type      | Coverage          | Use Case                  |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Macro     | Several km radius | Rural or wide-area zones  |
| Micro/Small | Few 100 meters   | Urban/dense areas         |

**💡 Example**: On a road trip, your music keeps playing as your phone switches between towers.

## 📻 Wireless Frequencies

Wireless uses **specific frequency bands** measured in hertz (Hz) to transmit data:

### 🌐 Common Bands

| Band         | Use Case & Traits                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2.4 GHz**  | Older Wi-Fi (802.11b/g/n) — better wall penetration, more interference |
| **5 GHz**    | Newer Wi-Fi (802.11ac/ax) — faster but shorter range           |
| **4G/5G**    | Cellular (700 MHz – 28 GHz) — higher = faster, but shorter range |

**⚖️ Trade-Offs:**
- Lower freq = More range, less speed  
- Higher freq = Less range, more data  
- ⚠️ Congestion/interference is common  

Governed by agencies like the **FCC** to prevent spectrum clashes.
