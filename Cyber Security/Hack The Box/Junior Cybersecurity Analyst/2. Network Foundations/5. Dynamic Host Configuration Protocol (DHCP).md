# 🔄 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

## 📘 What is DHCP?
- **DHCP** stands for **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**
- It **automatically assigns IP addresses** and other network settings (subnet mask, gateway, DNS) to devices on a network.
- Prevents **manual IP assignment**, reducing errors and admin work.

---

## 🧠 Why DHCP is Important
- Eliminates IP conflicts by assigning **unique addresses**.
- Frees up unused IPs through **leasing** (temporary assignment).
- Ideal for **dynamic or large-scale networks**.

## 🏗️ Key Roles

| Role         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DHCP Server** | Manages and assigns IP addresses (e.g., router, dedicated server).          |
| **DHCP Client** | Requests an IP address (e.g., laptop, smartphone, IoT device).              |

## 🔁 DORA Process (DHCP Workflow)

**DORA** = Discover → Offer → Request → Acknowledge

| Step     | What Happens                                                                      |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Discover** | Client sends a broadcast message to find a DHCP server.                       |
| **2. Offer**    | Server responds with a proposed IP address and config info.                  |
| **3. Request**  | Client replies, requesting the offered IP address.                           |
| **4. Acknowledge** | Server confirms and assigns the IP address to the client.                     |

## ⏳ IP Lease & Renewal

- IPs are leased **temporarily** (e.g., 24 hrs).
- Before expiration, the client sends a **renewal request**.
- If approved, server **extends the lease** via another ACK message.

---

## 🧪 Example Scenario

> 🧍‍♀️ Alice brings her laptop to the office for the first time:

1. Laptop sends a **DHCP Discover** to the network.
2. DHCP server offers **192.168.1.10**.
3. Laptop replies with a **Request** for that IP.
4. Server **Acknowledges** → IP is assigned.

Later, before the lease expires:
- Laptop sends a **renewal request**.
- Server responds with another **ACK**, confirming continued access.

---

## 🧠 TL;DR Summary

- DHCP **automates IP assignment** → no manual config needed.
- Uses the **DORA** process for IP leasing.
- Great for dynamic networks, saving time and reducing errors.
- Leases expire → clients must **renew** to keep their IP.
